# Credit Card Churn Prediction using Advanced Machine Learning (XGBoost)

## Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. This project applies an **Advanced Machine Learning approach using XGBoost** to predict whether a credit card customer will churn based on historical customer behavior and transaction data.

XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its high performance, scalability, and accuracy in classification problems.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior data to identify churn patterns
- Build an advanced machine learning model using XGBoost
- Achieve high prediction accuracy and robustness
- Assist financial institutions in customer retention strategies

## Technology Stack
Language: Python  
Libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related information such as:
- Demographic details
- Credit card usage
- Transaction amount and frequency
- Credit limit
- Account activity

Target Variable:
Churn  
1 -> Customer churned  
0 -> Customer retained
