#Credit Card Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
#📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for financial institutions. This project aims to predict whether a credit card customer will churn or not using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
By identifying potential churners early, banks can take proactive measures to retain customers.

#🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer behavior using historical credit card data

Build an ANN model to predict customer churn

Improve decision-making for customer retention strategies

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics

#🧠 Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Model Used: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
