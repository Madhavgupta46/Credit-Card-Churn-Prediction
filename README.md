# Credit Card Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for financial institutions to retain valuable customers. This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a credit card customer is likely to churn based on historical customer data and transaction behavior.

## 🎯Objectives
- Analyze customer data to identify churn patterns
- Build an ANN-based classification model
- Predict customer churn with high accuracy
- Support banks in making data-driven retention decisions

## 🧠Technology Stack
Language: Python  
Libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 📂Dataset Description
The dataset consists of customer information including:
- Demographic details
- Credit card usage
- Transaction frequency
- Credit limit
- Account activity

Target Variable:
Churn
1 -> Customer churned  
0 -> Customer retained

## ⚙️Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Scaling
4. ANN Model Construction
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation

## 🧪ANN Model Architecture
- Input Layer: Based on number of features
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: Sigmoid activation (Binary Classification)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

## Results
- The ANN model effectively predicts customer churn
- Achieved strong accuracy on test data
- Demonstrates the usefulness of deep learning in churn prediction
- Future Scope
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Comparison with machine learning models
- Model deployment using Flask or Streamlit
- Real-time churn prediction system
